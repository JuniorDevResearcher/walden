  "description": "ASTI collects primary time-series data on agricultural research capacity and spending levels through national survey rounds in over 80 low-and middle-income countries. Data collection is carried out by country focal points, who distribute survey forms to all agencies known to conduct agricultural research in a given country, including government, nonprofit, and higher education agencies. Private-for profit sector coverage is limited, and hence excluded from this dataset. More detailed country- and regional-level data on agricultural research capacity, investment, and outputs are available on www.asti.cgiar.org/data.",
