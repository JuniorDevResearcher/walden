  "description": "p10/90 calculated from PovcalNet figures for income/consumption share by decile and survey mean as follows. Firstly the total income received by the bottom 10/90% is calculated. Then the average income of an arbitrarily small group around the p10 threshold is estimated by locally fitting a lognormal distribution based on the decile share and mean. ",
